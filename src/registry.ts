/**
 * The buyer tool registry — every Buyer API endpoint, in one array.
 *
 * ── WHY IT IS ITS OWN MODULE ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `index.ts` is the MCP server's ENTRY POINT: it calls `main()` at the bottom,
 * so importing anything from it starts a server on stdio. `@crossly/buyer-cli`
 * generates its whole command tree from this list, and a CLI that spawned an
 * MCP server merely by asking "what commands exist?" would be a genuinely
 * confusing bug.
 *
 * One definition, two surfaces, no second list to keep in step.
